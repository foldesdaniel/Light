The goal of the game is to solve the "puzzle" as fast as you can.

### Rules

There is a number in every black square (if there is not then the value is 0).

The black square number should be equal to the lamps count surrounding it.

### Storage

The game stores the saved game in the local storage, so it is temporary only.
If you close the browser window then your saves are lost.
